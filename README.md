# Job Failure Characterization and Prediction in HPC Datacenter Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting machine learning (ML) job failures within the SURFLisa HPC cluster. It includes an in-depth examination of various aspects such as failure statistics, arrival patterns, CPU usage, time correlations of failures, and peak analysis. Furthermore, the project involves the implementation of a hybrid LSTM-TCN model to predict the occurrence of failed jobs across varying time granularities, leveraging insights from failed ML jobs. 

## Repository Structure

- **job_analysis/**: Contains scripts for analyzing the data and generating plots. 
- **job_prediction/**: Includes code for predicting failure events based on historical data.
- **job_datasets/**: Stores the datasets used for analysis and prediction.
